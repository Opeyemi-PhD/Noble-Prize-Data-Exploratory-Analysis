# Project Overview
The Nobel Prize has been among the most prestigious international awards since 1901. Each year, awards are bestowed in chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. In addition to the honor, prestige, and substantial prize money, the recipient also gets a gold medal with an image of Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896), who established the prize. The dataset used in this project is from the Nobel Prize API and is available in the `nobel.csv` file.


In this project, I perform Exploratory Analysis on the Nobel Prize Dataset to uncover key insights and answer interesting questions about laureates, categories and gender distribution.
